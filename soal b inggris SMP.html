Doctor is a popular job. It takes a great responsibility to work as a doctor. Minor mistakes made by a doctor can bring the lost of a patient.<br/>

There are a lot of jobs that doctors must do. They are expected to evaluate symptoms and run a test to determine what is wrong with a patient. If a. doctor does not know off handedly what the diagnosis should be, it is his or her responsibility to do the necessary research.<br/>

Notes are kept on each patient to ensure that any medical professional can walk into a room and know what has been done in the past. It is also a way to track the patients' progress during recovery.
Writing prescriptions is a major part of doctors' jobs. They must know how much medicine to prescribe based on the patient's history; they also need to know how two drugs can interact with one another.<br/>

A doctor needs to know not only how to treat the current conditions, but also how to advise the patient on how to prevent another occurrence.<br/>
