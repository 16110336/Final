On Friday, June 12th, I woke up at six o'clock and no wonder, it was my birthday. But of course I was not allowed to get up at that hour, so I had to control my curiosity until a quarter to seven. Then I could bear it no longer, and went to the dining room, where I received a warm welcome from Moortje (the cat).<br/>

  Soon after seven I went to Mummy and Daddy and then to the sitting room to undo my presents. The first to greet me was you, possibly the nicest of all. Then on the table there were a bunch of roses, a plant, and some peonies, and more arrived during the day.<br/>

  I got masses of things from Mummy and Daddy, and was thoroughly spoiled by various friends. Among other things I was given Camera Obscura, a party game, lots of sweets, chocolates, a puzzle, a brooch, Tales and Legends of the Netherlands by Joseph Cohen, Daisy's Mountain Holiday (a terrific book) and some money. Now I can byThe Myths of Greece and Rome - grand!<br/>
  Then Lies called for me and we went to school. During recess I treated everyone to sweet biscuits, and then we had to go back to our lessons.
Now I must stop. Bye-bye, we're going to be great pals!<br/>

JAKARTA : Blasts struck at the heart of Jakarta on Thursday, leaving at least seven people dead and 19 injured after suicide bombers and a group of armed men attacked Indonesia's capital city. The deadly blasts and gun attacks took place in Jl. MH Thamrin, one of Jakarta's busiest main streets in Central Jakarta, located not far from government ministries and the State Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan said on Thursday that all five terrorists died in the attack: two were suicide bombers and the rest died during a shoot-out with the police. ''All perpetrators are Indonesians and are dead,''he told journalists.<br/>
<br/>
There were four blasts recorded in the area, commonly known as Sarinah, where Jakarta's oldest shopping mall is located. Civilians and police officers are among the 19 people injured and they were taken to several hospitals in Jakarta. At least five police officers are in critical condition from the blasts and gunshots.<br/>
<br/>
The terrorists also shot police officers and threw grenades that lead to a shoot-out at noon. Police found five bombs with bigger impact believed to be exploded by the group. "We suspect that the first bomb was for fishing for a bigger explosion,'' Anton said.<br/>
<br/>
He also said the perpetrators are believed to be related to the radical Islamic State (IS) group as there were warnings from the group after the attacks that killed 130 people in a string of attacks in Paris in November.<br/>
